This project is about me experimenting with rotation and having one object point towards 
another and have it move locally based on that. 

I'm also testing a new code structure involving making the main program and game loop a
class. Not gonna lie, I dislike it a lot, so I'll go back to how I usually go about it.

I've learned quite a few things while writing this. Most importantly, how point an object
towards another object, and how I could use that to make pivot points work.

What do you think? Next time I might research sin and cos and how I could use them in my
future projects. I'm also getting in Numpy, finally. I've heard that they can make
certain things like making lists or, nested lists much faster and more optimized, 
so I can't wait for that. Anyway, see you later!
